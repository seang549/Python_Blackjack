# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the text-based Blackjack game! This project allows you to play Blackjack against the computer dealer in the console.

## How to Play

1. Run the script and follow the prompts to start a new game.
2. You will be dealt two cards, and the dealer will also receive two cards.
3. Decide whether to 'hit' (draw another card) or 'stand' (keep the current hand).
4. The game will continue until you choose to stand or exceed a total score of 21.
5. After you finish, the dealer will play by drawing cards until reaching a score of 17 or higher.
6. The winner is determined based on the final scores, with Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) being the highest.

## Features

- Dynamic card dealing with an unlimited deck size.
